Spawn is the easiest way to build, maintain and scale a Cosmos SDK blockchain. Spawn solves all the key pain points engineers face when building new Cosmos-SDK networks.
  - **Tailor-fit**: Pick and choose modules to create a network for your needs.
  - **Commonality**: Use native Cosmos tools and standards you're already familiar with.
  - **Integrations**: Github actions and end-to-end testing are configured right from the start.
  - **Iteration**: Quickly test between your new chain and established networks like the local Cosmos-Hub devnet.

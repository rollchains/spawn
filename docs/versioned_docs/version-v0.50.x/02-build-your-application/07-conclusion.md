# Conclusion

You just crafted your first blockchain, module, and custom logic with Spawn. You have a fully functioning name service that allows users to set and retrieve their account names.

## What you Learned

* Generating a new chain with your desired characteristics
* Scaffolding a module
* Setting the protobuf structure for transactions, queries, and Storage
* Adding custom business logic to a module's server handlers
* Configuring the command line client
* Running a local testnet
* Interacting with the network

## What's Next?

Extend the NameService to include IBC support with the [ibc-module](./08-ibc-module.md) tutorial.

<!-- TODO: What's next? (further interaction, Go,TS,Python, public testnet with github, frontend, explorer, cosmwasm) -->
<!-- TODO: query via rest api -->
